                       visiting a website. You will be amazed by its clean layout, cool animations, and impressive\n                        visuals. But how does this work and who is behind all this? Simply put, a front-end developer\n                        who wrote the CSS/HTML to convert the designs into a beautiful functioning website.</p>\n                    <p data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">As of January 2020,&nbsp;the web&nbsp;has&nbsp;around&nbsp;1.5\n                        billion websites. New websites are coming to life every day.&nbsp;Hence the reason for the web\n                        developer’s job security.<br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>“Behind every successful man, there\n                            is a strong woman.”<br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>“Behind every fascinating website,\n                                there is a strong team of front-end developers.”</p>\n                    <p data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">If we visit a job recruiting website, we see that the job title\n                        “Front-end developer” is widely required. But&nbsp;what’s&nbsp;that job precisely? What should\n                        we know before we starting trying it? You would possibly&nbsp;think those answers are pretty cut\n                        and straight, but they’re anything but that. Front-end development&nbsp;goes&nbsp;through\n                        something of a&nbsp;psychological state.&nbsp;In this post, we will try to describe what does it\n                        mean to be a front-end developer. This will be based on my experience and also through various\n                        conversations, I have had with several other front-end developers. The more people you ask, the\n                        more you realize that different people or organizations understand this differently. By\n                        understanding how the role of a front-end developer varies from company to company, you will get\n                        a better idea of what a front-end developer does.</p>\n                    <h2 id=\"[hardBreak]What-is-a-front-end-developer?\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">\n                        <br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>What is a front-end developer?</h2>\n                    <p data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">A front-end developer is responsible for the website architecture\n                        and the way the website elements render to the user interface. Front-end development, which is\n                        also considered to be the client-side development, is&nbsp;the&nbsp;practice&nbsp;of\n                        producing&nbsp;HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for&nbsp;an internet site&nbsp;or Web\n                        Application.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, everything that a user can see and interact with is\n                        created by a front-end developer, with the help of a back end developer at times of course. The\n                        real challenge for this is that we live in an incredibly dynamic environment. New tools are\n                        being introduced every day and you have to bear this in mind every time you are building\n                        something.<br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/><br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>Almost every\n                            organization or agency on the market hires front-end developers. So it’s\n                            an&nbsp;employment&nbsp;and&nbsp;a typical&nbsp;job title. But what does it mean? Here are\n                            some answers we got:</p>\n                    <ul data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">\n                        <li data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">Front-end development is everything a user sees and interacts\n                            with on a website. Everything that has to do with the user interface is a front-end job.\n                        </li>\n                        <li data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">the term “front-end developer” is relatively newer than the\n                            term CSS or HTML. In the beginning, everyone was a webmaster, or as we commonly say now, a\n                            full-stack developer. But if the word would have existed, back in the time, this kind of\n                            developer would be considered to be a front-end developer.\n                        </li>\n                        <li data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">&nbsp;A front-end developer thinks of himself as&nbsp;an\n                            internet&nbsp;designer and website architect. He doesn’t feel he has the extensive expertise\n                            of a back-end developer. However, he still spends all of his time&nbsp;using and interacting\n                            with the&nbsp;browser.\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <p data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">So, the job of a front-end developer is closely related to the\n                        browser. You&nbsp;should be familiar with&nbsp;the browser, more so than other roles in web\n                        development. To note, that, just like the websites, the number of new browsers is also getting\n                        bigger and bigger.<br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>Maybe the front-end work is inevitably\n                            related to the user interface. A back-end developer doesn’t have to bother with the\n                            interface if their job is establishing a database connection. But if you consider yourself a\n                            front-end developer, you definitely have to.<br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>There\n                                are&nbsp;a ton of&nbsp;different devices and browsers.

Yes, it’s the language&nbsp;within the&nbsp;browser, but\n                            now it’s the language in&nbsp;numerous&nbsp;other places too.</p>\n                    <h2 id=\"[hardBreak]Front-end-Roles\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"><br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>Front-end Developer Roles</h2>\n                    <p data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">For the sake of the argument, let’s fork the term front-end\n                        development. Let’s use&nbsp;UX and JavaScript engineers. Can one person be great at both? Maybe\n                        we overwhelm ourselves in two very different directions.

Some front-end developers don’t want to\n                            be configuring build tools. They think of themselves as being at the front of front-end\n                            development, whereas&nbsp;others&nbsp;are at&nbsp;the background&nbsp;of front-end\n                            development.<br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>This divide is super frustrating to\n                                people&nbsp;at once.</p>\n                    <h2 id=\"Hiring\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">Hiring a front-end developer</h2>\n                    <p data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">A new trend is spreading on the web technology these days. A lot\n                        of back-end developers are losing their jobs and being replaced by Javascript experts. Plenty\n                        of&nbsp;things that&nbsp;before used to&nbsp;be back-end responsibilities are now built and on\n                        the front-end area, which also known as the client-side. Component-driven design, site-level\n                        architecture, routing, getting data from&nbsp;the back-end, mutating data,&nbsp;integrations\n                        with&nbsp;APIs, and managing state—all&nbsp;of these&nbsp;things are now largely a front-end\n                        responsibility.<br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/><br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>Before, a\n                            front-end developer would need a back-end developer’s help to integrate with an API.\n                            However, all the latest changes have given the opportunity to the front-end devs to be\n                            independent and make them on their own. For example, GraphQL gives them everything they need\n                            when it comes to the Data they need.<br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>And all the so-called\n                                traditional front-end work, with the user-interface, has not gone away. On the contrary,\n                                that has evolved and changed as well.</p>\n                    <h2 id=\"Career\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">Career as a front-end developer</h2>\n                    <p data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">Many organizations are advertising to hire&nbsp;a front-end\n                        developer. But before they do that, they need to decide whether they need someone to work with\n                        Angular, Webpack and GraphQL or HTML, LESS, and page accessibility. All of them are part of the\n                        front-end job. And remember,&nbsp;they might as well take the time and learn new\n                        technologies.&nbsp;However, when it&nbsp;comes&nbsp;to hiring new people,&nbsp;it has to be\n                        related to the talent and skills the people have and how to get the best out of them.<br\n                            data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/><br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>Furthermore, it’s about\n                            how specialized your work usually&nbsp;is.

The hiring part&nbsp;is\n                                certainly&nbsp;the worst part. You will want to keep it as simple as possible. You need\n                                to be very clear about what you want from this front-end developer and look at their\n                                past experience. <br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/><br data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>There’s&nbsp;a huge difference between the CSS markup\n                                    and the technical tasks.

The website design\n                        revolution has begun some years ago with the Javascript frameworks like AngluarJS, ReactJS and\n                        now we’re seeing its effects. If a year ago a front-end developer would be considered the\n                        “dummy” developers, that are all about colors and sizes, these days the myth has fallen. Being a\n                        front-end web developer today means that you not only create the graphical user interface (GUI)\n                        that enables access to the software’s back-end features and capabilities. It means that you are\n                        an engineer who is responsible not just for the looks of a website, but for the functionality,\n                        speed, and website data connections. Starting a career in front-end development has never been\n                        so exciting and rewarding as it is today.</p>\n                    <div className=\"flex flex-wrap items-center gap-4 mt-8\">\n                        <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://sherocommerce.com/what-is-a-front-end-developer/&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin&amp;src=share_button\"\n                           title=\"Share on Facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\n                           className=\"shared-counts-button facebook shared-counts-no-count\" data-postid=\"21610\"\n                           data-social-network=\"Facebook\" data-social-action=\"Share\"\n                           data-social-target=\"https://sherocommerce.com/what-is-a-front-end-developer/\"\n                           data-wpel-link=\"external\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">\n                         <span className=\"shared-counts-icon-label\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">\n                            <span className=\"shared-counts-icon\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">\n                               <svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"18.8125\" height=\"32\" viewBox=\"0 0 602 1024\"\n                                    data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">\n                                  <path\n                    d=\"M548 6.857v150.857h-89.714q-49.143 0-66.286 20.571t-17.143 61.714v108h167.429l-22.286 169.143h-145.143v433.714h-174.857v-433.714h-145.714v-169.143h145.714v-124.571q0-106.286 59.429-164.857t158.286-58.571q84 0 130.286 6.857z\"\n                    data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>\n                               </svg>\n                            </span>\n                            <span className=\"sr-only\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">Facebook</span>\n                         </span>\n                        </a>\n                        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?url=https://sherocommerce.com/what-is-a-front-end-developer/&amp;text=What%20is%20a%20front-end%20developer%20and%20how%20to%20think%20like%20one%3F\"\n                           title=\"Share on Twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\n                           className=\"shared-counts-button twitter shared-counts-no-count\" data-postid=\"21610\"\n                           data-social-network=\"Twitter\" data-social-action=\"Tweet\"\n                           data-social-target=\"https://sherocommerce.com/what-is-a-front-end-developer/\"\n                           data-wpel-link=\"external\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">\n         <span className=\"shared-counts-icon-label\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">\n            <span className=\"shared-counts-icon\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">\n               <svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"29.71875\" height=\"32\" viewBox=\"0 0 951 1024\"\n                    data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">\n                  <path\n    d=\"M925.714 233.143q-38.286 56-92.571 95.429 0.571 8 0.571 24 0 74.286-21.714 148.286t-66 142-105.429 120.286-147.429 83.429-184.571 31.143q-154.857 0-283.429-82.857 20 2.286 44.571 2.286 128.571 0 229.143-78.857-60-1.143-107.429-36.857t-65.143-91.143q18.857 2.857 34.857 2.857 24.571 0 48.571-6.286-64-13.143-106-63.714t-42-117.429v-2.286q38.857 21.714 83.429 23.429-37.714-25.143-60-65.714t-22.286-88q0-50.286 25.143-93.143 69.143 85.143 168.286 136.286t212.286 56.857q-4.571-21.714-4.571-42.286 0-76.571 54-130.571t130.571-54q80 0 134.857 58.286 62.286-12 117.143-44.571-21.143 65.714-81.143 101.714 53.143-5.714 106.286-28.571z\"\n    data-uw-styling-context=\"true\"/>\n               </svg>\n            </span>\n            <span className=\"sr-only\" data-uw-styling-context=\"true\">Tweet</span>\n         </span>\n                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                </article>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Post1;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
